### Little note
1. The backend dir is FAKE !!!. I want to use Flask originally but in vain.
2. The current upload ipfs mechanism is totally work at the frontend with Pinanta API.
3. I should save my Pinanta API key in the secret .env file but I don't know why it doesn't work now. So I will just expose my key for now.

### file note
- The fancy homepage is Homepage.js
- The ipfs upload is NFTuploadForm.js
- I keeps your Main.jsx, but it is useless now since I integrate it into the homepage.

### How to start this shit
It is totally the same as before
```bash
1. cd frontend
2. npm install
3. npm start
```
